## STORY

After a strong earthquake in the south of the country, your little farm has ended up completely upside down: the cows are next to the lettuces and your shoes are right next to the eggs. What a mess!

To make things easier for yourself and assess the damage, your mission is to group every pair of items you come across as quickly as possible.
