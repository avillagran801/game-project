## GAME STORY

After a strong earthquake in the south of the country, your little farm has ended up completely upside down: the cows are next to the lettuces and your shoes are right next to the eggs. What a mess!

To make things easier for yourself and assess the damage, your mission is to group every pair of items you come across as quickly as possible.


## ABOUT THE GAME

Farm Shuffle is an Android developed on Unity for the UdeC Mobile Game Development course of 2025-2.

It's based on the card game Dobble and has a cozy pixel art aeshtetic inspired on Stardew Valley.


## SPECIAL THANKS
